In this Challenge you are given the Abstract Shape Class and empty Rectangle, Square, and Triangle classes.
    - Rectangle inherits from Shape
    - Square is a "special" rectangle so will inherit from Rectangle.
    - Triangle inherits from Shape.
1. Implement the Rectangle, Square, and Triangle classes such that The area of each can be 
    - retreived through the .GetArea() method.
2. You must only accept the length of the sides in the constructors along with the name and number of sides.
3. 

**Remember constructors aren't inherited.**
