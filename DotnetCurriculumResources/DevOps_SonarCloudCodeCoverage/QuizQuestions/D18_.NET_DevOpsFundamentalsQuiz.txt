~Monitoring of applications
~Continuous Integration
~Agile planning

::What is true about Cycle Time?
{
=You act by delivering working software to real users.
~The client decides what goals to pursue.
~You select three options for what you can deliver.
~You observe the market needs and their overall behavior.
}

::DevOpsFundamentals
::How can you get Validated Learning?
{
=Through each cycles feedback.
~Only when you go to the next loop.
~During the cycle time.
~When the client gives you feedback.
}

::DevOpsFundamentals
::What is an important aspect of the implementation of DevOps?
{
=Validated Learning helps shorten the Cycle Time.
~Validated Learning helps extend the Cycle Time.
~Cycle Time helps shorten the Validated Learning.
~Cycle Time helps extend the Validated Learning.
}

::DevOpsFundamentals
::How do you shorten Cycle Time?
{
=Continuous integration and continuous delivery
~Continuous delivery
~Continuous integration
~With efficient practices and tools
}

::DevOpsFundamentals
::What is CI?
{
=The process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.
~The process of automating the build and testing of code the first time a team member commits changes to version control.
~The process of automating the testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.
~The process of automating the build of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.

::What does the developer submit when a feature is complete?
{
=pull request
~push request
~his changes
~the pipeline
}

::DevOpsFundamentals
::Why would a release pipeline be created?
{
=To automate the deployment of a new build.
~To prevent a bottleneck in an application.
~To prevent delays and errors.
~To optimize process time and eliminates idle time.
}

::DevOpsFundamentals
::What happens if CD is not implemented?
{
=Software release cycles are a bottleneck for application and operations teams.
~Software allows a “fail fast” approach to validation.
~Software automate the deployment of a new build.
~Software triggers an automated build system to grab the latest code from the shared repository.

::What are the parts of the OODA Loop?
{
=Observe, Act, Decide, Orient
