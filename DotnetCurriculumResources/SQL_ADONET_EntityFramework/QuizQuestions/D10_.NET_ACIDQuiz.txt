::What happens when you have a high degree of isolation?
{
=You can limit the number of concurrent transactions.
~You can limit the number of Loggings.
~A high number of transactions.
~A low number of concurrent transactions.

::ACID
::How do you make a transaction durable?
{
=By specialized logging.
~By performing only a subset of interdependent operations.
~By transforming one consistent state of data into another consistent state of data.
~By a concurrent transaction.

::ACID
::What's the correct definition for Atomicity?
{
=The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.
~The entire transaction takes place at once or does happen at all.
~A part of the transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.
~The entire transaction takes place at all.

::ACID
::What's the correct definition for Consistency?
{
=The database must be consistent before and after the transaction.
~The database must not be consistent before and after the transaction.
~The database must be consistent before the transaction.
~The database must be consistent after the transaction.
}

::ACID
::What's the correct definition for Isolation?
{
=Multiple Transactions occur independently without interference.
~Multiple Transactions occur independently with interference.
~Multiple Transactions occur dependently with interference.
~Multiple Transactions occur dependently without interference.
}

::ACID
::What's the correct definition for Durability?
{
=The changes of a successful transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs.
~The changes of a successful transaction occurs when the system failure occurs.
~The changes of a transaction occurs when the system failure occurs.
~The changes of a successful transaction occurs while the system failure occurs.
