::What does Isolation Levels define?
{
=The degree to which a transaction must be isolated from other data modifications made by any other transaction.
~The degree to which a Savepoint can exists within a single transaction.
~The degree to which a level must be modified by any other transaction.
~The degree to which a transaction commits ends within a Relational Database and allows all other users to see the changes.

::What is the name of the Read Error that happens when a transaction reads data that is new and has not yet been committed by another transaction?
{
=Dirty Read
~Phantom Read
~Repeatable Read

::What is the name of the Read Error that happens when a transaction reads the same row twice and gets a different value each time?
{
=Non-Repeatable Read
~Repeatable Read
~Dirty Read
~Phantom Read
}

::TransactionsAndIsolationLevels
::What is the name of the Read Error that happens when two identical queries are executed but the rows retrieved by the two are different?

::TransactionsAndIsolationLevels
::Which statement is true for "serializable"?
{
=The only transaction isolation level that provides complete isolation from concurrency effects.
~One of the transaction isolation levels that provide complete isolation from concurrency effects.
~The only transaction isolation level that provides partial isolation from concurrency effects.
~One of the transaction isolation levels that provide partial isolation from concurrency effects.

::TransactionsAndIsolationLevels
::What does the Repeatable Read isolation level guarantee? 
{
=To read only committed data.
~Not to change before the transaction ends.
~To also read committed data.
~Not to change after the transaction ends.
}

::TransactionsAndIsolationLevels
::What does Read committed level can do?
{
=See committed data from different points in time.
~Allow all three concurrency phenomena.
~Provide complete isolation from concurrency effects.
~Block until the exclusive lock on the row is freed.
